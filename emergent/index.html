        <h3>Emergent systems</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of the course was to research novel ways of arriving to
          architectural forms. I was interested in the phenomenon of emergence.
          A process entirely different from conscious design, it is responsible
          for the majority of forms in nature and arguably in the built
          environment. I considered emergence to be the creation of new forms
          <b> emerging </b> from the interactions between elements that affect
          one another. This occurs at a scale smaller than the one in which the
          new form emerges. Consequently, I set out to create a system that
          might produce emergent forms, following three constraints: - The
          system must be made up of many individual elements - Each element must
          affect the other elements in the system - It must start as a collage
          in paper
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          To make a simple emergent system to study, I cut many individual
          elements of cardstock. String between elements makes each element
          affect the other in the system when moved.

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          I made many of these systems until I started seeing new forms emerge.
          Each iteration varied the size of the elements, the length of the
          string, the number of elements in the system and the background on
          which they moved.

        <h3>Capturing New Forms</h3>

        <p>
          The creation of each new system was informed by my attempts to try and
          capture new arising forms. I used physical and digital processes as a
          means to record them. I also wanted to explore projection of these new
          forms from two to three and four dimensions (x, y, z and time) to
          arrive at architectural space. To do this practically, I used
          spray-painting, printmaking and digital sampling.

        <p>
          I started noticing that I could use animation and change through time to create new forms.

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The animation could be sampled digitally to create a new 3 dimensional
          form by stacking each frame of the animation. I wanted to capture the
          new spaces that where formed as the elements blocked the grid behind
          them.

        From the resulting geometry would emerge architectural forms.

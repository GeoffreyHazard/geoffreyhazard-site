      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The course was created after an introduction I made between one of my
        professors in American Studies, Steve Lubar, and a boat-builder, Shep
        Shapiro. I had helped Shep with one of his boat building projects, and
        was integrating boat construction techniques into my own work, such as
        the Boatrobe, since the Fall of 2017. This new course allowed
        me to build a small dory from scratch, side by side with a
        boat-builder. The course was co-taught by Steve, Shep and Prof. Chris
        Bull, director of the Brown Design Workshop. I led two of the
        lab sections, facilitated discussions in class, and worked alongside Shep
        after hours building many aspects of the boat to make sure we stayed on
        schedule. It was the first hands-on, collaborative course in the Brown
        Design Workshop.
      </p>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>
        I guided students in groups of four to create their own full-size
        lofting on a sheet of plywood. Lofting involves drawing a set of
        two-dimensional lines in three different views to describe the hull in
        three dimensions.

      <p>
        We used the full-sized lofting as a mold to laminate the inner and outer
        stems of the boat. The stems are where the planks join at the stern and
        bow of the boat, forming a rabbet joint. I taught each student to chisel
        and plane these rabbet joints by hand.

      <p>
        We also used the lofting to build stations, six sections slicing the
        boat at different hull widths. These are not part of the final boat, but
        serve as a mold. Combined, the two dimensional stations form a three dimensional
        mold that describes the complex curving planes.

      </div>

      <p>
        To determine the width of each plank, we used thin pieces of straight
        pine called battens. The battens allowed us to visualize the planks and
        create "fair" curves with no irregularities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, I led two sections to plank the hull using 1/4 inch marine
        plywood. We made at least 40 specialized clamps to glue the planks
        evenly along their entire length. This process had to be done in two
        weeks, so I also traced, cut and glued planks on my own to stay on schedule.

        During the final week, I worked alongside Shep to make and glue the
        outer keel and gunwales.

        We then put the final coats of paint on, and installed the oarlocks and
        thwarts inside the boat. I mentored some students who wanted to build one of
        these parts as a final project.

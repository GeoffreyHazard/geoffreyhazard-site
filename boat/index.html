      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The course was created after an introduction I made between one of my
        professors in American Studies, Steve Lubar, and a boat-builder, Shep
        Shapiro. I had helped Shep with one of his boat building projects, and
        was integrating boat construction techniques into my own work, such as
        the Boatrobe, since the Fall of 2017. However, this new course allowed
        for me to build a small dory from scratch, side by side with a
        boat-builder. The course was co-taught by Steve, Shep and Prof. Chris
        Bull, director of the Brown Design Workshop. I got to lead two of the
        lab sections, facilitate discussions in class, and work alongside Shep
        after hours building many aspects of the boat to make sure we stayed on
        schedule. It was the first hands-on, collaborative course in the Brown
        Design Workshop.
      </p>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>
        I guided students in groups of four to create their own full-size
        lofting on a sheet of plywood. Lofting involves drawing a set of
        two-dimensional lines in three different views to describe the hull in
        three dimensions.
      </p>

      <div class="image-grid"></div>
      <p>
        We used the full-sized lofting as a mold to laminate the inner and outer
        stems of the boat. The stems are where the planks join at the stern and
        bow of the boat, forming a rabbet joint. I taught each student to chisel
        and plane these rabbet joints by hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also used the lofting to build stations, six sections slicing the
        boat at different hull widths. These are not part of the final boat, but
        serve as a mold.
      </p>

      <div class="image-grid"></div>

      <p>
        To determine the width of each plank, we used thin pieces of straight
        pine called battens. The battens allowed us to visualize the planks and
        create "fair" curves with no irregularities.
      </p>

      <div class="image-grid"></div>

      <p>
        Next, I led two sections to plank the hull using 1/4 inch marine
        plywood. We made at least 40 specialized clamps to glue the planks
        evenly along their entire length. This process had to be done in two
        weeks to stay on schedule, so I also helped by cutting and gluing some
        of the planks after hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the final week, I worked alongside Shep to make and glue the
        outer keel and gunwales.
      </p>

      <div class="image-grid"></div>

      <p>
        We then put the final coats of paint on, and installed the oarlocks and
        thwarts inside the boat. Some of parts inside the boat counted as
        individual student's final projects.
